README - Randomize

Author
Chase Zemanek

Overview
Randomize is a code package for the Unity3D game engine that makes it easier to
inject randomness into projects through the use of special type objects that can
provide a random value from a collection of values given.

Setup
Simply add the "Randomize Asset" folder to your Unity3D project's assets folder. This can
be done either in the file browser, or by dragging the "Randomize Asset" folder and dropping
it into the project window.

Other Information
Randomize was developed and tested with Unity 5.0.0 and should work with all Unity 5 versions.
It may also work on previous versions of Unity, but I'm not sure.

Contributions
If you find a problem, create an issue and I will get to it when I can.
